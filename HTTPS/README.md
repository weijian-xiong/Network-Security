# HTTPS Project

## Three parts of HTTPS project:
<br />Part 1: HTTP is not secured
<br />Part 2: Symmetric Key Crypto is secured but difficult to exchnage keys
<br />Part 3: Asymmetric Key Crypto & Digital Certificate

## Technology used for this project:
1. Client/Server communication
<br />Use Python language to implement socket program for client/server communication in ubuntu system.
    
    - Python version: 3.6.9
    - Ubuntu version: 18.04.4

2. Wireshark
<br />Use for capture the communication between client and server
    
3. Prevent Attack

4. Cryptography
<br />Symmetric key cryptography
    - Fernet library
    
    Asymmetric key cryptography
    
    HTTPS = HTTP + SSL
    
5. Digital Certificate
    - CSR, X.509
    - Environment: Ubuntu, Firefox browser
